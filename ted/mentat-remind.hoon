:: %mentat sub-thread to set a message to be sent later
::
::  NB: 
::    User should specific "AM" for a given time
::      LLM will not consistently interpret user times as a 24-hour format
::    User should interpret all input and output times as UTC.
::    User must specify repetition as one of the pre-define intervals.
::      I experimented with a getting the LLM to produce a list of intervals, 
::      for a Pomodoro session for example, but had limited success in getting
::      accurate results.
::    Repeated events are limited to an arbitrary count of ten reps since there is no easy way to cancel them presently.
::    Repeated events may be stopped early (along with all other threads) with the Dojo :spider|kill
::
::  There is something wrong with running several events at once.
::    Running a one-off event at the same time as a repeated event generally works.
::    Running a one-off event while another one-off event is in progress generally doesn't.
::      The most recently started event wins, not the chronologically next event to happen.
::    With +timers / scrying %behn I have even observed:
::      Three timers waiting to %wake as expected, but only two produced the expected chat messages.
